How I configured my Arduino IDE environment

Add arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json, http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json to the Additional Board Manager field

Select the board Adafruit ESP32 Feather, which works with a Adafruit HUZZAH32 â€“ ESP32 Feather Board https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather-board?variant=43873434122

The dependencies required are the "Adafruit Unified Sensor" library and the "Adafruit AM2320 sensor library".

Used 115200 baud rate for serial monitor
